This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.6.

## Toelichting bij deze eindopdracht

This prototype application was created for RealEstateCare. Because the assignment was provided in Dutch and the application is aimed at Dutch users, the codebase was written in English and the UI is in Dutch.

The prototype application consists of a dashboard which has the following available functionalities:
1. An overview of planned inspections ("Gepland")
2. An overview of completed inspections ("Afgerond")
3. A knowledge base ("Kennisbank")
4. A settings page ("Instellingen")

Clicking the "Details" button in the overview of either the planned or completed inspections will open a page showing the full details of that inspection.

Because the requirements of the prototype did not include a functioning settings page, filled knowledge base or functionality of the bottom tab bar buttons these functionalities have not (yet) been developed. All buttons in the bottom tab bar currently lead back to the Dashboard. The settings can be saved but do not alter the application in any way.
